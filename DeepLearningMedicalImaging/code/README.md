# Kaggle challenge for Medical Imaging

## Lymphocytosis classification

As part of the course Deep Learning for Medical Imaging, we work on lymphocitosis classification. 
For each patients, we have digital images of blood smears as well as clinical data (age and lymphocyte count). The objective of the challenge is to design the best model to decide wheter a patient has cancer or not.

## Run the pipeline 

The command to train the model `python3 main.py`.

## 

To do a submission, the path of the weights and biases has to be change in the file submit.py. Then to run a submission, the command is `python3 submit.py`.
